# roller-derby-info

A roller derby information page. Created as part of the SheCodes Basics Add-on course.

Copied over the code from the html file I had been working on as part of the SheCodes Basics Add-on course. Thought it would be a good idea to add this to my GitHub to keep a record of projects I work on as I learn more.
